<h2> ðŸŒ¸ About Anime Movies </h2>
<p class="lead">
    Anime movies are <strong> Japanese  </strong>  animated films that combine art, storytelling, and music to create deeply emotional
    experiences. Unlike many Western animated films that often focus on children, anime movies cover a wide range of
    genresâ€”romance, fantasy, science fiction, slice of life, and psychological drama. They are known for their beautiful
    animation, emotional depth, and unique cultural themes such as family, love, loss, destiny, and personal growth.
    Studios like Studio Ghibli, CoMix Wave Films, and Studio Chizu have made anime movies globally popular, showing that
    animation can be for all ages. </p>
