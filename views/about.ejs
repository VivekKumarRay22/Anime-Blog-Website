  <h1>About This Blog</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Welcome to <strong>My Blog</strong>!  
    This is a simple blogging website built with Node.js, Express, EJS, Bootstrap, and a lot of curiosity.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started this project to practice full-stack development and to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiments
    with the world. Here youâ€™ll find posts about technology, coding, and random things that inspire me.
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog doesnâ€™t use any database (yet ðŸ˜…). All posts are stored temporarily in memory,
    just to keep things simple while I learn the full development process.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to keep building, keep learning, and eventually turn this project into something bigger.
    Thanks for stopping by and being part of the journey ðŸš€
  </p>

  <p>
    â€” <em>Vivek Kumar Ray</em>
